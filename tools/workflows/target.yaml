# A makefile path is checked against each key represented as a regex until
# a matching one is found from top to bottom. If found, its targets are used
# to build a corresponding makefile in the same order they are defined in
# the rule. It's recommended to keep regexes as much specific as possible.

# This makefile is intended to be run manually to test all STM32WLxx related
# testhal projects. So, there is no need to test its targets in CI.
