*** Next ***
- NEW: STM32 ADCv2 now supports return code on start function.
- NEW: Integrated FatFS with lwIP HTTPD, now it is possible to serve files
       using HTTP from a storage device.
- NEW: Updated FatFS to version 0.14b.
- NEW: SPIv2 driver has been implemented on: STM32F0, STM32F1, STM32F3,
       STM32F4, STM32F7, STM32G0, STM32G4, STM32L0, STM32L4, STM32L4+,
       STM32H7.
- NEW: New SPIv2 driver model, it is compatible with the previous SPI driver
       and introduces: better runtime errors handling, slave mode,
       data synchronization function, various other improvements.
- NEW: Added an alternate port for ARMv7-M, it uses less RAM and it is
       faster at interrupt processing, it is slightly slower at
       thread-to-thread context switch so it is not a full replacement.
- NEW: Now all xxxStart() functions in HAL are able to report a driver
       activation error.
- NEW: Support for STM32G031, STM32G041, STM32G0B1, STM32G0C1.
- NEW: Made STM32H7 non-cacheable memory option also shareable.
- NEW: EFL driver and demo for STM32F3xx.
- NEW: New unit test subsystem under /os/test. Now it is officially
       ChibiOS/TEST.
